Hi, my name is Angel. I'm a Ruby/Rails and JavaScript web developer who enjoys learning new technologies. I especially love functional programming and continue to learn it on the side while I pay the bills. I am currently learning C#/.NET to broaden my capabilities.

I've also dabbled in many other languages such as: Haskell, Java, C, Elm, Purescript, TypeScript, F#, Ocaml, SMl, Oz, Racket, Shen, APL, J, Scala, D, Go, COBOL, ATS, Idris, Elixir, Rust, Erlang, Python, Lua, and others I can't think of.

As you can see, I am a fan of programming languages and enjoy learning about them and what makes them special.

I'm also an academically trained musician and my interests also lie in the computer realm. Of the music making languages, I've dabbled in Pure Data, Supercollider, Faust, ChucK, CSound, Nyquist, Euterpea, Sonic Pi, Jython Music, and some others. I'm most familiar with Max/MSP however.
