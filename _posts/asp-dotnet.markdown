I am learning C# and all things .NET (dotnet) and oh boy is it a huge undertaking! For example, the main framework for web development is ASP.NET Core but it's not like Rails where you just create the app and start coding. Right from the get-go, you'll have to decide if you want to use the MVC template, the webapp template, a blank one, with Angular, with React, a webapi, it just goes on!

In this case, I will be talking about the MVC template. This will be quite similar to Rails' philosophy. One glaring difference between the two is how ASP.NET Core deals with models. Whereas in Rails, you only have to define one model to represent some object in the database as well as in your views, in ASP.NET Core, you'll have one model for the database, and a separate model for the view.
