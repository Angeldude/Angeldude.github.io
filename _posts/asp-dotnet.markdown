I am learning C# and all things .NET (dotnet) and oh boy is it a huge undertaking! For example, the main framework for web development is ASP.NET Core but it's not like Rails where you just create the app and start coding. Right from the get-go, you'll have to decide if you want to use the MVC template, the webapp template, a blank one, with Angular, with React, a webapi, it just goes on!
