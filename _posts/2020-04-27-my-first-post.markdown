Welcome! I will be detailing all the things I learn here, hopefully. Thanks for visiting! 
(2024 Edit: Perhaps I should be clearer now. I was initially going through Mark Tarver's Logic, Proof, and Computation and writing about it here. I do plan on coming back to those lessons but now this has become a more general (but still technical?) blog™️.)
